# README

Hello!

As the next step in the AeroFS recruiting process, we'd like you to do a
take-home development exercise. This exercise should take no longer than a
couple hours for the basic requirements.

Please send us back your results within the next two weeks--if you've got
travel or something else coming up and this timetable doesn't work for you,
just let us know and we'll push that back further.

Good luck, and we hope you have fun with this!

## What files live where

* `frontend_design_spec.md` has a copy of the information/requirements for this
  exercise.
* `backend_design_spec.md` should contain the spec for what you want the
  backend developer to build so that your frontend demo app would actually work
  someday. Once you have your app more or less working, you'll need to write
  this.
* `index.html` is your main HTML page. 
* Your JS code goes in `/source`s. There's an app.js file in there already to get
  you started. Any libraries you use as dependencies can go in `/node_modules` (if not
  linked via a CDN).
* Your stylesheets go in `/style`s. There's a `style.cs`s file in there already
  to get you started. If you'd like to use a CSS preprocessor like SCSS or
  LESS, great! Make sure to include the original SCSS/LESS file(s), not just
  compiled CSS, when you send your code back so we can see them.
* `/fixtures` contains a fake data file, `fakedata.json`, to help you get
  started.

If you'd rather organize your code differently, go for it. Just update this
README file accordingly.

## Viewing the app for development

To run the frontend only app use the following command from inside the aero-tiny-chat directory
run:

    yarn start
